// However our main driver should obly interact with the Movies class

// Example
// - create a Movies object
// - ask the Movies object to add a movie by providing 
//   name, rating and watch-count
// - ask the Movies object to increment the watched count by 
//   1 for a movie, given its name
// - ask the Movies objec to display all of its movies
