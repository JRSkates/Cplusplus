## C++ Learning Journey

Welcome to my C++ learning journey! This document outlines the steps and progress I've made as I learn and master C++ programming. The learning plan focuses on building foundational knowledge, applying concepts in small programs, and exploring the versatility of C++.

## Primary Learning Resource

I am primarily using the [Beginning C++ Programming](https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/learn/) course on Udemy to guide my learning process. This course provides structured lessons and exercises, helping me build a strong foundation in C++.

## Learning Plan

### **Days 1â€“3: C++ Basics**
#### **Day 1: C++ Setup and First Programs**
- **Setup**:
  - Installed VS Code with the necessary extensions for C++ development.
  - Set up the clang++ compiler and configured `tasks.json` for building and running programs.
- **First Programs**:
  - Created a "Hello, World!" program.
  - Developed a program that takes user input and prints it.
  - Built a program that accepts two user-inputted numbers and calculates their sum.

#### **Day 2: Variables, Constants, Arrays, and Vectors**
- **Variables and Constants**:
  - Learned how to declare and initialize variables in C++.
  - Explored `const` for defining immutable values.
- **Arrays and Vectors**:
  - Worked with arrays for fixed-size collections of elements.
  - Explored `std::vector` for dynamic-size collections and applied basic operations like adding and iterating over elements.
- **Statements and Operators**:
  - Studied arithmetic, relational, and logical operators.
  - Practiced using statements for calculations and conditionals.

#### **Day 3: Control Flow**
- **If-Else Statements**:
  - Learned to use conditional statements to handle decision-making in programs.
- **Loops**:
  - Implemented loops (`for`, `while`, and `do-while`) to iterate over collections and perform repetitive tasks.
- **Functions**:
  - Explored how to define and call functions for modular code design.

## Progress Highlights
- Set up a complete C++ development environment using VS Code and clang++.
- Wrote multiple programs to practice core concepts, including input handling, arithmetic operations, and control flow.
- Developed foundational knowledge of variables, arrays, vectors, and conditional logic.

## Next Steps
After mastering the basics, I plan to:
1. Dive deeper into object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
2. Explore advanced topics such as pointers, memory management, and file I/O.
3. Create a small project, such as a text-based game or a dynamic to-do list application, to solidify my understanding.
